## Question 1

## Creating the birthday simulation function

``` r
bday_sim = function(n_room) {
  birthdays = sample(1:365, n_room, replace = TRUE)
  repeated_bday = length(unique(birthdays)) < n_room
  repeated_bday
}
bday_sim(20)
```

    ## [1] FALSE

## Running simulaton for room sizes 2-50

``` r
bday_sim_results = 
  expand_grid(
    bdays = 2:50,
    iter = 1:10000   
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    results = map_lgl(bdays, bday_sim)
  ) %>% 
  group_by(bdays) %>% 
  summarize(
    prob_repeat = mean(results)
  )

#adding summary table 
bday_sim_results %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    digits = 3,
    caption = "Estimated probability that at least two people share a birthday"
  )
```

Estimated probability that at least two people share a birthday

As the group sizes increase, it becomes more likely that there will be
atleast 2 people who share the same birthday. \## Creating visualization

``` r
bday_sim_results %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = bdays, y = prob_repeat)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Probability that at least two people share a birthday",
    x = "Group size (n)",
    y = "Probability of shared birthday"
  )
```
